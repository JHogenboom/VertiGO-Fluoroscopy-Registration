This folder contains an example of the data structure that is used by the software that is described in this repository.

The folders that contain the word _output_ are generated by the software and not necessary for use.

In practice, the software uses a single folder per PatientID.

The _in_- and _output_ seperation serves to illustrate not only what is required as input, but also what can be expected as output.

-------------------------------------
_The folder should be located in **Projectdir** that is requested at the execution of RegisterImage_.

_The folder name should be equal to **PatientID** in the RegisterImage file_.
